### 👩‍💻 About me (EN)

I’ve always been passionate about technology. I wrote my first lines of code when I was still in high school, around the age of 17. Since then, I’ve taken many online courses to deepen my general knowledge and enter the tech field. I've remained deeply in love with programming ever since, constantly striving to learn more and become a better professional each day.
